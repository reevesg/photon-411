                    <p class="lead mb-0">Photon is always looking to grow our crew with motivated sailors who want to be part of a focused, competitive, and collaborative racing program. We're building a team that shows up prepared, committed, and excited to push performance on the water.</p>

                    <p>We welcome sailors with varying levels of experience, but some prior sailing background is required. More important than experience alone is reliability, curiosity, and a willingness to learn. Our goal is to build consistency—both in who shows up and how we sail—so crew members are expected to make most races and practices, or to be clear and dependable about their availability.</p>

                    <p>Our sailing season typically runs from May through October, with a mix of Wednesday night racing, weekend races, and scheduled practice sessions throughout the season.</p>
                    <p>We're looking for crew who can participate consistently and reliably. While we understand that life, work, and family commitments come first—and that no one can make every race—we value clear communication and follow-through. Being able to plan ahead, sign up in advance, and honor commitments helps keep the team running smoothly.</p>

                    <p>Just as we prepare thoroughly for racing, we take a structured approach to crew organization and communication. Team members are part of a dedicated WhatsApp group for coordination and updates, and a shared Google signup system for races and practices. Clear communication and mutual respect are essential to how we operate.</p>

                    <p>On the water, crew are trained to specialize in specific positions so we can sail efficiently and build trust as a team. At the same time, we rotate roles during practices to develop well-rounded sailors who understand the whole boat and can step in when needed.</p>

                    <p>Safety and preparedness are non-negotiable. Crew are expected to have appropriate gear for the conditions—ranging from PFDs and proper clothing to full foul-weather and safety equipment depending on the race.</p>
                    <p>If you have questions about safety requirements, we'll work with you to make sure you understand what's needed and are properly equipped before joining us on the water.</p>
