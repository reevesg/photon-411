                    <p class="mb-0">Our program focuses on the major Chicago and Lower Lake Michigan events, with a commitment to strong preparation, smart sailing, and continuous improvement. We race hard, but we also value teamwork, learning, and the shared pursuit of getting the most out of both the boat and ourselves.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Our mission is to build a competitive, committed, and inclusive sailing team that consistently performs at the highest level in Chicago and Great Lakes racing—pushing the limits of our boat, our skills, and ourselves while fostering teamwork, learning, and a shared passion for racing.</p>

                        <h3 class="h5 text-primary mb-3">1. Prepare Relentlessly</h3>
                        <p>We believe strong results come from disciplined preparation. From rig setup and sail selection to race planning, we focus on doing the fundamentals exceptionally well before the starting gun ever fires.</p>

                        <h3 class="h5 text-primary mb-3">2. Build a Consistent, Committed Team</h3>
                        <p>Performance comes from continuity. We prioritize regular participation and shared responsibility so trust, communication, and instincts develop over time. A stable crew makes the boat faster.</p>

                        <p>We value smart decision-making, clean maneuvers, and minimizing unforced errors. We aim to win through consistency, awareness, and execution rather than risky hero moves.</p>

                        <h3 class="h5 text-primary mb-3">4. Be Data-Driven and Always Improving</h3>
                        <p>We collect and use data—on boat speed, sail setup, maneuvers, and race outcomes—to understand what actually makes us faster. Post-race debriefs turn observations into insights, and insights into measurable improvement.</p>

                        <p class="mb-0">We foster an environment built on respect, accountability, and shared purpose. Strong results come from teams that enjoy showing up, learning together, and pushing each other to be better.</p>

                    <p>Photon is owned by Dean Doman and Gareth Reeves, both lifelong sailors with deep experience on the water.
